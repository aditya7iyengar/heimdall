## Naming

Heimdall (pronounced _Haim-Doll_) in norse mythology is the "ever-vigilant" god
who guards Bifrost (pronounced _Byff-Rost_), the rainbow bridge that leads to
Asgard.

## Use Case

Say you have to share your SSN with someone. You don't want to say it out loud
on phone, and you also don't want to email it to them because it's a permanent
record of your secure information.

Heimdall allows you to share SSN using a temporary link (which disappears in
5 mins or any configurable amount of time) and you can choose to encrypt it
using a key or PGP.
